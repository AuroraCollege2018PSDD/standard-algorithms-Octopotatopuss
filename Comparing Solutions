I've decided to use Amber's code to compare and evaluate. 

Strengths:

* logical use of def the #subroutine arrays 
* Use of len
* Except Value Error
* Some comments for clarifying parts of the code

Weaknesses:

* Probably intended as a joke, but those names can get a lil confusing on what exactly you're identifying and def. 
* the structure of the Elif may cause bugs/interruptions
* Line 28, numElements doesn't match line 22, numberElements

Similarities: 

* Max( .... Array)
* SumArray 

Differences:

* """ for number in nootArray:
        kString = kString + str(number) + " "
    print(kString)   """""
    

*  """" print('You have {} number/s in your array'.format(numElements)) """"
